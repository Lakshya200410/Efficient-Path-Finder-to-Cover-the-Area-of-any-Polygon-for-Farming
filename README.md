# 🌾Efficient-Path-Finder-to-Cover-the-Area-of-any-Polygon-for-Farming

# 🚀 Project Summary
This project introduces an AI-powered path planning system designed to cover irregularly shaped farming plots with maximum efficiency. It leverages computational geometry and heuristic optimization to generate complete coverage paths for use cases like irrigation, pesticide spraying, sowing, and harvesting.

# 🎯 Objectives
🖐️ Handle irregular polygonal field boundaries

🚜 Generate minimum-overlap efficient traversal paths

🛩️ Dynamically detect and avoid obstacles (e.g., trees, rocks)

🌱 Support real-world agricultural use like smart tractors, drones, or irrigation bots

# 🔍 Problem Statement
Most existing coverage algorithms are designed for rectangular or grid-based fields. This leads to:

🌪️ Wasted energy from redundant movements

🌊 Overlapping or missed zones during spraying/irrigation

⚠️ Inefficiency in fields with natural obstacles

# 🧠 Key Innovations
Polygon Decomposition using Delaunay Triangulation for path planning

Heuristic Search for efficient traversal

Obstacle-Aware Planning that updates paths in real-time

Graph-Based Knowledge Representation of farm layout

Solves a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) with AI-style heuristics
